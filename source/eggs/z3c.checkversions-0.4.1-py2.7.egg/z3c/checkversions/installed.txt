Checking installed versions
---------------------------

>>> from z3c.checkversions import installed
>>> checker = installed.Checker()

We just check we can get the versions:

>>> versions = checker.get_versions()
# Checking your installed distributions
>>> 'z3c.checkversions' in versions
True

Checking for upgrades availability is already done in buildout.txt
