====================================
Options shared by all the recipes
====================================

Notes
--------

    - All recipes inherit all these options, depending which you are using, those options will have an incidence on the build.
    - Useless to say that the recipes code is not difficult, and as a deployer, its your job to have a look at the code to avoid surprises.
    - If you are inside a minitage all recipes will look on your minibuild dependencies section to get things into the environment at execution time. Like feeding CFLAGS, pkgconfig, ldflags and so on.
    - All recipes look for a minitage section in your buildout file and take dependencies and eggs as minitage projects to get into the environnment too::

        ...
        [minitage]
        dependencies = postgresql-8.3
        eggs = py-libxslt-1.1

Options
-------------
    * urls
      A set of urls to checkout in the form


        - The last part or the urls will be the name of your checkout dir unless you have precised the name in "destination directory name"
        - If you don't specify any scm_type, it will be static unless you specify it in options (see scm)
        - If you don't specify any revision, it will be not set unless you specify it in options (see scm_revision)
        - The form is a New line separated list of urls to fetcha in the following form (*the | is part of the line ;)*)::

                url to checkout | fetch_type | revision | destination directory name | fetcher_args

      Here are valid inputs ::

            svn://toto | svn | 666 | mydirectoryname | --ignore-externals
            svn://toto | svn | 666 | mydirectoryname
            svn://toto | svn | 666
            svn://toto | svn | | | --ignore-externals
            svn://toto | svn
            file://toto
            http://tata/toto.tgz

      Where::

            fetch_type ::= bzr | hg | git | static (for ftp://, file://, http:// and local files) | svn
            
    UNAME is a platform identifier from:

    - url(-UNAME) (backward cmpatibility)
        url to get the source from, in the previous urls syntax
    - scm
        default scm to use (a valid minitage fetch factory to use (static, git, svn, bzr, hg).)
        defaults to static.
    - scm_revision

    - md5sum

        path to the patch program
    - patch-options
        options to feed the patch program with [see cmmi recipe for documentation]
    - patches
        patches to apply [see cmmi recipe for documentation]
    - patch
        A patch to apply, compatibility with zc.recipe.cmmi
    - patches-UNAME / UNAME-patches
        - patches to apply to a system or a favor of this system (linux, darwin, freebsd, freebsd, freebsd(6,7,8), snowleopard, leopard, cygwin)
    - location
        where to put the build result. (default to parts/PART_NAME)
    - cc(-UNAME)
        CC compiler to use (set env['CC'], default not set
    - cpp(-UNAME)
        CPP compiler to use (set env['CPP'], default not set
    - cplusplus(-UNAME)
        c++ compiler to use (set env['C++'], default not set
    - includes(-UNAME)
        directories to add to the include search (compatibility)
    - ldflags(-UNAME)
        LDFLAGS to set at compilation time
    - cflags(-UNAME)
        CFLAGS to give to the compiler
    - includes-dirs(-UNAME)
        Directories to add to the include paths  [see cmmi recipe for documentation]
    - libraries(-UNAME)
        libraries to give to the linker eg: libiconv
    - library-dirs(-UNAME)
        Directories to add to the linker, and they will be added as -rpath too. [see cmmi recipe for documentation]
    - rpath(-UNAME)
        Directories to add as -rpath.
    - skip-flags: do not set CFLAGS/LDFLAGS/LD_RUN_PATH at all.
    - environment
        a part name where we can get key/values to add to the build environment [see cmmi recipe for documentation]
    - path(-UNAME)
        line separated list of paths to append to $PATH during build
    - pkgconfigpath(-UNAME)
        line separated list of paths to append to $PKGCONFIGPATH during build [see cmmi recipe for documentation]
    - pythonpath(-UNAME)
        line separated list of paths to append to $PYTHONPATH during build

    - osx-target: -mmacosx-version-min setting, wanting users will know what that means ;)

        minitage put -mmacosx-version-min in the env. if you dont set this to 'false'
        default value on leopard is 10.5.0 and on snowleopard 10.6.0

    - force-osx-target

        force MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to value or default if 'true' (snowleopard (10.5) /leopard(10.6))

Options incidences
----------------------

 - `minitage.recipe:cmmi`
    executable is not taken in account.
 - `minitage.recipe:fetch`
    only the download related options are used.
 - `minitage.recipe:eggs`, `minitage.recipe:wsgi`, `minitage.recipe:scripts`, `minitage.recipe:printer`
    the configure-*, and make-*, and extra_options are not used

Patches
-----------

    - They can be either a file or an url.
    - You have means to specify options to the patch program, like -pXXX, abuses of it.
