        Introduction
        ============
        
        ZopeSkel provides a collection of project templates for Plone and Zope
        development projects.
        
        ZopeSkel uses the `paster <http://pythonpaste.org/script/>`_ Python library
        internally.
        
        The ABCs of typical Plone development
        =====================================
        
        For the typical developer working on a plone project, the following path is
        recommended:
        
        * Install ZopeSkel package to virtualenv, or otherwise
          isolated from system Python installation, on your local computer.
        
        * Create a new Plone 4 development installation using the
          ``plone4_buildout`` template.
        
        * Create a new logic package for the content types, forms and logic of the
          site. This can be done using the
          `Dexterity ZopeSkel template <http://collective-docs.plone.org/content/dexterity.html>`_
          (included in ``plone4_buildout``).
        
        * Create a new theme package for the site. This can be done using the
          `XDV template <http://collective-docs.plone.org/templates_css_and_javascripts/xdv.html>`_
          (included in ``plone4_buildout``).
        
        * Test and develop on your local computer until everything is perfect.
        
        * Put created packages under source code sversion control (Subversion, Git).
        
        * Create a Plone installation on the production server. For this step the
          Plone Unified installer is the preferred method of building a distribution.
        
        * Install your site customization packages on the production server.
        
        Installing ZopeSkel
        ====================
        
        ZopeSkel can be installed in one of two ways: with `buildout
        <http://www.buildout.org/>`_ or with `virtualenv <http://virtualenv.org/>`_.
        
        .. note ::
        
            Despite existing documentation to the contrary, it is not recommended to
            install ZopeSkel in your system python.
        
        Buildout installation
        ---------------------------
        
        Here are instructions how to include ZopeSkel as a part of your
        local ``buildout.cfg``.
        
        * You can use zopeskel to add new projects to your buildout ``src/`` folder.
        
        * You can use code skeleton local commands to add more content to your
          package.
        
        .. note ::
        
            The ``plone4_buildout`` template has ZopeSkel and paster support out of
            the box and this is not needed if you used ``plone4_buildout`` to create
            your ``buildout.cfg``.
        
        Add to your ``buildout.cfg``::
        
            parts =
               ...
               zopeskel
        
            [zopeskel]
            # installs paster and Zopeskel
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg
            eggs =
               PasteScript
               ZopeSkel
        
        After re-running buildout, you will have ``zopeskel`` and ``paster``
        commands in the ``bin`` directory of your buildout.
        
        Virtualenv installation
        -----------------------
        
        First, install virtualenv into your system::
        
            easy_install virtualenv
        
        Next, create a virtual environment with the new ``virtualenv`` command::
        
            virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute zopeskelenv
        
        Once virtualenv is finished, you can install zopeskel to your new virtual
        environment::
        
            zopeskelenv/bin/easy_install zopeskel
        
        Once this is complete, you will be left with ``zopeskel`` and ``paster``
        commands in the ``bin`` directory inside your virtualenv.
        
        Available Templates
        ===================
        
        To see details of the available templates::
        
            zopeskel --list
        
        More info about how zopeskel works::
        
            zopeskel --help
        
        Using Templates
        ===============
        
        Creating a Plone 4 buildout using virtualenv ZopeSkel installation::
        
            source zopeskelenv/bin/activate
            zopeskel plone4_buildout yourfoldername
        
        The folder created (``yourfoldername``) can be checked in to the versioning
        system of your choice.  It is now a portable, self-contained, ready-to-build
        Plone site.  You can build the system at any time using the following::
        
            cd yourfoldername
            python bootstrap.py
            bin/buildout
        
        The ``plone4_buildout`` recipe results in a self-contained version of ZopeSkel
        installed via the buildout method described above. It thus provides the
        ``zopeskel`` and ``paster`` commands inside its ``bin`` folder. You can use these
        commands inside the buildout to create packages for your new Plone site::
        
            bin/zopeskel plone3_theme src/plonetheme.yourcompanyid
        
        The command will ask a few questions such as the desired package name and
        description, and output a complete package you can immediately start using.
        Interactive help is available by entering "?" as a response to any question.
        
        .. note ::
        
            Because ZopeSkel is built on paster you can do anything we describe here
            using the ``paster`` command directly.  If you do so, you can gain access to
            certain features of ``paster`` that have been disabled for ``zopeskel``, but
            you also will lose access to many of the nicer features of ``zopeskel``,
            including validation and in-line help.
        
        Local Commands
        ==============
        
        In addition to project templates, the ZopeSkel system provides local commands.
        Local commands are context aware commands that help you to add more
        functionality to an existing ZopeSkel generated project.
        
        .. note ::
        
            Local commands require using the ``paster`` command directly - the
            ``zopeskel`` command does not support them yet.
        
        .. note ::
        
            Not all ZopeSkel templates provide local commands.  In general, if local
            commands are available, you will be informed of the fact as your new
            package is generated.
        
        Using local commands to create a content type package
        -----------------------------------------------------
        
        To use local commands you need to first include the paster command in your ``buildout.cfg``
        as instructed above.
        
        Starting inside your Plone buildout, first create a new archetypes add-on::
        
            cd src
            ../bin/zopeskel archetype mycompanyid.mycustomcontenttypes
        
        Next, change directories into your new package and invoke ``paster`` to add a
        content type::
        
            cd mycompanyid.mycustomcontenttypes
            ../../bin/paster
        
            Usage: ../../bin/paster COMMAND
            usage: paster [paster_options] COMMAND [command_options]
        
            ...
        
            Commands:
            ...
        
            ... local commands:
                addcontent   Adds plone content types to your project
        
        
        As you can see from the ``paster`` command output, your new package supports a
        local command called ``addcontent``. You can use the ``addcontent`` command
        to add new code to your package. As with both ``zopeskel`` and ``paster``,
        you can use the ``--list`` option to see what local commands are available
        in the context of the package you've created::
        
            ../../bin/paster addcontent --list
        
            Available templates:
                atschema:      A handy AT schema builder
                browserlayer:  A Plone browserlayer
                contenttype:   A content type skeleton
                form:          A form skeleton
                formfield:     Schema field for a form
                i18nlocale:    An i18n locale directory structure
                portlet:       A Plone 3 portlet
                view:          A browser view skeleton
                zcmlmeta:      A ZCML meta directive skeleton
        
        You can add an archetypes content type for managing lectures::
        
                ../../bin/paster addcontent -t contenttype LectureInfo
        
        Then you can add schema fields to that content type::
        
                ../../bin/paster addcontent -t atschema
        
        Local commands can be run as many times as needed to create your package.
        You can iteratively develop your content type, other content types, and
        more.
        
        .. note ::
        
            When changing your package code, local commands will often change
            GenericSetup XML files (found in the in ``profiles/default`` folder of your
            package). These changes will not appear in Plone/Zope simply by restarting your
            instance. You will usually need to re-install your package in your development
            Plone site if you run any local commands in a package you've already installed.

        Developing ZopeSkel
        ===================
        
        If you wish to contribute to the zopeskel project we welcome your
        contribution. Zopeskel is now distributed with its own built-in buildout, so
        to begin, all you need to do is check out the source, bootstrap with your
        desired version of python, and run bin/buildout. A couple of things to keep in
        mind while you work:
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        Since version 1.5, ZopeSkel has tests. It's required to run these before you
        check in any changes you make. You should run the full test suite in both
        Python 2.4 and Python 2.6, as both versions are in common use among Zope and
        Plone developers. They can be run like so::
        
            bin/test -s zopeskel
        
        Please ensure that all tests pass in Python 2.4 and Python 2.6 before making
        any checkins to the trunk of zopeskel.
        
        Fixing Bugs
        -----------
        
        There are a number of open issues in the queue at
        http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues and your help is always welcome in
        closing any you feel competent to take on. Please note that there is a
        zopeskel mailing list, so if you have any questions about your approach to
        fixing a bug, you should post to the list first.
        
        Running trunk version
        ----------------------
        
        The easiest way to run the trunk of zopeskel is to check out the code,
        bootstrap the buildout with your favored version of Python, and run
        bin/buildout::
        
            svn co http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/trunk zopeskel
            cd zopeskel
            python2.6 bootstrap.py
            ...
            bin/buildout

        -------------------------
        
        * Add bin/zopeskel --version flag.  Reports current version of zopeskel
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/48)
          [cewing]

          [cewing]
        
        * use i18n:domain plone for portlet title so it need not be translated twice
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/44)
          [fRiSi]
        
        * use the correct name of package, so it can be used in package with 2 dots or
          1 dots in package name
          [lucmult]
        
        2.17 - June 14, 2010
        --------------------
        
        * Added a pin for PasteScript>=1.7.2.  This solves an issue where using zopeskel
          with an early version of PasteScript resulted in a method signature mismatch
          on the paster command 'challenge' method.  Fixes issue #42
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/42)
          [cewing]
        
        * Fixed lingering problem in Archetypes template with registering a 'locales'
          directory before one is created.  Users now need to add an i18nlocale via
          addcontent in order to get this directory and have it registered via zcml.
          [cewing]
        
        * Fixed dependency in Archetypes template doctests on the presence of the log-in
          portlet.  Tests now open the 'login_form' instead.  Resolves issue #40
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/40)
          [cewing]
        
        * Added new browserlayer localcommand for plone and archetype templates.
          [marcosfromero]
        
        * Added stub locales directory for plone3_theme template, resolving issue #33
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/33)
          [cewing]
        
        * Set the GenericSetup profile version number in the generated
          metadata.xml to 1000, which is better for the alphabetical ordering
          that GS does.
          [maurits]
        
        * Added "environment-vars = zope_i18n_compile_mo_files true" to
          plone3_buildout template. This is enabled only for Plone 4 (eggifiedzope is
          true).
          [vincentfretin]
        
        2.16 - March 22, 2010
        ---------------------
        
        * Fixed syntax error in generated portlet constructor code
          [ajung]
        
        * Added a new 'BoundedIntVar' variable type.  It validates that the provided
          argument is both an integer and between provided min and max values (inclusive
          on both ends).
          [cewing]
        
        * Updated archetype and plone3_portlet templates to comply with pep8 and
          pyflakes validation at all stages of a skeleton build process.  Resolves the
          issue here: (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/24)
          [cewing]
        
        * Added explanatory text to the plone_hosting template regarding the fact that
          it is unsuitable for use with plone versions later than 3.1.7, fixed
          http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/25
          [cewing]
        
        * Fixed the problem with generated archetypes content type meta_type names
          documented here:
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/22)
          [cewing]
        
        * Updated tests for the plone template to include tests for the fixes to message
          factory, zcml sub-package include and i18n translation registration problems
          below
          [cewing]
        
        * Cleaned up a number of issues with defining and importing a package-wide
          MessageFactory in plone template local commands:
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/29)
          [cewing]
        
        * Cleaned up a number of issues with importing sub-package zcml files after
          using local commands in the plone template:
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/28)
          [cewing]
        
        * Fixed an issue with the plone template zcmlmeta local command to ensure that
          the proper directive was inserted into the top-level configure.zcml
          [cewing]
        
        * Fixed the bug in the plone template that caused zcml errors when the
          i18nlocale local command had not been run:
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/26)
          [cewing]
        
        * Improved i18n for portlets
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/31)
          [fRiSi]
        
        * Improved test coverage of the zopeskel script
          [cewing]
        
        * Disallowed use of the paster --svn-repository command due to some basic
          incompatibilities with the way zopeskel is used.  The argument is still
          allowed for users via 'paster create'.
          (http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/34
          http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/35)
          [cewing]
        
        * Added a 'Register Profile' question to the plone template so that users can
          have a Generic Setup profile registered in the case that they plan on adding
          things (like portlets) that require a GS Profile to install.  Adapted
          downstream templates archetype, plone25_theme and plone3_theme to use the new
          question
          [cewing]
        
        2.15 - January 22, 2010
        -----------------------
        
        * Backed out a few changes from jaroel in favor of retaining working templates
          OOTB
          [cewing]
        
        * Made archetype, plone3_theme and plone3_portlet pass the PEP8 validator and
          pyflakes.
          [jaroel]
        
        * Template summaries (one-line descriptions) were improved.
          [pupq]
        
        * Templates now have an optional help attribute, which is a rich description of
          the template and its purpose. Help has been provided for all the ZopeSkel
          templates.
          [pupq/cewing]
        
        * Variables (questions in templates) now have a human-facing "title" attribute
          which can be shown instead of the (uglier + more opaque) actual variable
          name. Titles have been written for questions.
          [pupq]
        
        * Variables now have optional help attribute, which is a rich description of
          the variable. This can be shown in pastescript UIs.
          [pupq]
        
        * Interactive help has been added, so that you can enter "?" at any question to
          receive the rich help for that question.
          [cewing]
        
        * "Modes" have been implemented--easy, expert, and all--to reduce the number of
          questions posed to beginning users. For example, technical questions (like
          "namespace package 2") are now shown only in expert mode.
          [cewing/pupq]
        
        * The project name (eg, "plone.app.example") is now split into pieces to become
          the default values for namespace packages names ("plone", "app", "example").
          [pupq]
        
        * Templates can provide an ndot attribute that signals how many namespaces
          ("dots") are expected in the project name. When invoked through new zopeskel
          front-end script, names that don't support that pattern are rejected with
          help (eg, creating a plone_app with "plone.example" would be rejected, as a
          2-namespaced-name, "plone.foo.example", is expected)
          [pupq]
        
        * Rather than having to use the checkvar() and post() methods, templates can
          now support messages that appear pre-questions and post-generation.
          Appropriate warnings and where-to-go help has been added.
          [cewing]
        
        * Abstract classes for zope2 products and buildouts have been added; this
          simplifies inheritance of common attrs, and provides appropriate places for
          future common logic.
          [pupq]
        
        * A front-end script, 'zopeskel', has been added. This has high-level, friendly
          help, and an improved command line interface for the task of template usage.
          It can provide a friendly list of templates and a verbosely-detailed list of
          templates.
          [pupq/cewing/chrisrossi]
        
        * Users can have a "$HOME/.zopeskel" script with default values for questions,
          either on a all-template or template-by-template basis.
          [pupq]
        
        * The "zopeskel" script can emit a sample ".zopeskel" file, for editing.
          [pupq/cbc]
        
        * A simple HTML help generator can produce a listing of templates, fields, and
          subtemplates. This will be useful for maintaining an HTML "reference guide"
          to the ZopeSkel templates. Find this in the zopeskel.doctools package.
          [pupq/cbc]
        
        * Currently-failing unit tests were fixed.
          [pupq/cewing]
        
        * New unit tests were written for new features.
          [cewing]
        
        * New and repaired unit tests were added into the default test suite
          [cewing]
        
        * Rather than using a generic var() class for all variables ("questions"),
          subclasses for different types of variables--string, boolean, choices,
          etc.--were added. These normalize their own values and provide validation.
          Therefore, users will get earlier/better feedback on inappropriate values.
          [pupq/cewing]
        
        * A proposal for splitting the project into zopeskel.* packages was added.
          [pupq/cbc]
        
        * Where questions were duplicated across different templates, they were
          consolidated for consistency into one place, and referred to from other
          places.
          [pupq]
        
        * A real-time tool for generating graphs of dependencies and template
          inheritance was written, suitable for including in high-level documentation.
          Find this in the zopeskel.doctools package.
          [cbc]
        
        * Use the eggified Zope 2.12.3 for buildouts targeting Plone 4.x.
          Use 2.9.12 for buildouts targeting Plone 2.x.
          [maurits]
        
        * Remove unnecessary 'title' argument from jsregistry.xml example.
          This fixes http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/18.
          [dukebody]
        
        2.14.2 - December 8th, 2009
        ---------------------------
        
        * Back out untested, undocumented changes from paris sprint that broke some
          templates
          [MatthewWilkes]
        
        2.14.1 - November 19th, 2009
        ----------------------------
        
        * Fix packaging error
          [MatthewWilkes]
        
        2.14 - November 19th, 2009
        --------------------------
        
        * Use the eggified Zope 2.12.1 for buildouts targeting Plone 4.x. Bump 3.x
          default version to 3.3.2.
          [MatthewWilkes]
        
        * Use distribute for Plone buildouts
          [MatthewWilkes]
        
        * Remove extra quotes in a plone_pas template file, which were
          generating a syntax error.
          [dukebody]
        
        
        2.13 - October 3rd, 2009
        ------------------------
        
        * Pinned Cheetah to <= 2.2.1 and eliminated install_requires for elementtree
          (markdown not a requirement for Cheetah 2.2.1). Allows zopeskel to easy_install
          with python 2.4. Can remove pinning when markdown is fixed.
          [cbcunc]
        
        * plone3_buildout: added 'fake-zope-eggs = true' to the zope2 part, as
          otherwise you get e.g. 'ImportError: No module named ImplPython'
          when using a plone.recipe.zope2install < 3.0, like pinned by Plone
          3.2 versions.cfg.
          [maurits]
        
        * Make the Plone 3 buildout template default to Plone 3.3.1.
          [dukebody]
        
        * Modify HISTORY.txt convention in basic_namespace and nested_namespace
          templates. Use now "1.0dev (unreleased)" and '-' for changelog items.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        * Fix trove classifiers list url in all setup.py_tmpl
          [vincentfretin]
        
        * Remove old import_steps.xml from profiles/default/ in plone3_theme template,
          the various import step in registered in profile.zcml now.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        * For plone3_theme, plone3_portlet an archetype templates,
          start profile version at 1 to follow current convention.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        * Remove http://download.zope.org/ppix/,
          http://download.zope.org/distribution/, and
          http://effbot.org/downloads from find-links in the plone3_buildout template.
          Only Pypi or http://dist.plone.org/release/${plone_version}
          is really needed.
          Add http://dist.plone.org/thirdparty for alternative location for
          elementree, PILwoTk, markdown, python-ldap.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        
        2.12 - September 23rd, 2009
        ---------------------------
        
        * Remove the options fake-zope-eggs=true and
          additional-fake-eggs=ZODB3 in the plone3_buildout template since
          fake-zope-eggs is enabled by default in
          plone.recipe.zope2install>=3.0, with ZODB3 among the default "fake
          zope eggs".  [dukebody]
        
        * Declare a dependency on elementtree.  It's not a direct dependency
          of ZopeSkel, but ZopeSkel depends on Cheetah which depends on
          Markdown, which has an install-time dependency on elementtree but
          doesn't declare that.
          [davisagli]
        
        * remove the custom `egg_info.writer` and keywords for `paster_plugins`
          since this has been an entry point of PasteScript since 1.6.3, using
          the `setup_requires` as per the change log found here:
          http://pythonpaste.org/script/news.html#id4
        
          This solves an issue where the distutils would go into an infinite
          loop when you add a new `install_requires` package
          [claytron]
        
        * plone3_theme: made the generated viewlet.pt not crash when the
          accompanying view has not been changed so has no computed_value.
          Added some inline documentation there and fixed example
          registration.  [maurits]
        
        * In the plone3_theme say that we are creating a theme for Plone 3,
          not specifically for 3.0.
          [maurits]
        
        * In the plone template fix the generated INSTALL.txt: when telling
          users to add $project to the eggs, the example snippet should indeed
          add $project and not the $full_package_name.
          [maurits]
        
        * In the plone_app and plone3_portlet templates use the full package
          name instead of the project name in zcml lines in the generated
          INSTALL.txt.  The project/package/egg name may be 'silly' when the
          package structure is far/better/name, which means the zcml needs to
          be 'far.better.name'.  Thanks to Espen Moe-Nilssen for spotting this.
          [maurits]
        
        * Make the Plone 3 buildout default to Plone 3.2.2.
          [maurits]
        
        * Removed the setup.cfg from all templates. It makes the common operation of
          tagging and releasing packages harder with little benefit. It can be easily
          added by those who know about this particular feature.
          [hannosch]
        
        * Removed the useless `Python Modules` trove classifier from all templates.
          [hannosch]
        
        2.11 - February 5th, 2009
        -------------------------
        
        * Make the Plone 3 buildout default to Plone 3.2.1, and pick up
          ${versions:zope2-url} for Plone > 3.1
          [MatthewWilkes]
        
        * added a version requirement for Cheetah (>1.0)
          [tarek]
        
        * fix zopeskel/docs/localcommands.txt
          [yboussard]
        
        * Modify zopeskel/templates/plone/+namespace_package+/+package+/tests.py_tmpl
          to init egg as product if it is a Zope2 product.
          [yboussard]
        
        * Modify plone3_buildout template to ask for a Plone version. If the version
          is 3.0 or 3.1 it uses the plone install recipe, otherwise it uses the Plone
          egg from the cheeseshop.
          [MatthewWilkes]
        
        * Link to appropriate PyPI pages for recipes used.
          [MatthewWilkes]
        
        * Add a Zope 2 without Plone buildout template.
          [evilbungle]
        
        * Reconciling HISTORY.txt to mirror what can be found at the following:
          http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZopeSkel/2.10. Release of 2.10 was clobbered
          due to what looks like a merge at r74790.
          [andrewb]
        
        * Update plone2.5_template's buildout.cfg_tmpl to use Zope 2.9.10. This
          release incorporates Hotfix-2008-08-12. Defaulting to a known insecure
          Zope seems unwise for people that may be updating legacy environments into
          buildout, since they're likely to forget to include the hotfix. Url to
          2.9.10 hard-coded (as opposed to the more elegantly self-aware
          plone.recipe.plone approach) per the practice of a plone.recipe.distros
          plone part.
          [andrewb]
        
        * Nearly at the end of the creation of a ZopeSkel template, the local
          commands available for that template are displayed.
          [jaraco, markvl]
        
        * The Plone template now has local commands. (Basically moved them
          from the archetype templates to plone templates and made them
          available for both.
          [markvl]
        
        * Added base test setup to the archetype template. Added wiring code that
          runs README.txt as a doctest.
          [esartor]
        
        * Added tests to the addcontent contenttype command. These ammend the
          README.txt file for each content type providing basic tests for creating,
          editing and removing instances of the added content type.
          [esartor]
        
        
        2.10 - September 17th, 2008
        ---------------------------
        
        * Fixed a small bug that made most templates create a package that was
        * showing twice in the Plone quick
          installer is the top level namespace package was called 'Products'. Bug
          was fixed in the 'plone' template (since version 1.5), now in other ones
          where needed too.
          [davconvent]
        
        
        2.9 - September 1st, 2008
        -------------------------
        
        * Update silva buildout to reflect changes in Silva 2.1 as stable
          version, and 2.2 as development: SilvaLayout is not shipped anymore
          as an extra distribution but integrated in Silva all. Remove
          question, and update buildout.cfg template.
          [thefunny]
        
        
        2.8 - July 31, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Generate logrotate configuration file using collective.recipe.template
          so it does not need to contain absolute paths. This makes it possible
          to move the generated buildout around, or install it on other machines
          with different filesystem layouts.
          [wichert]
        
        * Also rotate instance1-Z2.log.
          [wichert]
        
        * Update documentation for hosting template to note that logrotate needs
          to be told where to put its status file.
          [wichert]
        
        
        2.7 - July 25, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
          - Switch default Plone version to 3.1.4.
            [wichert]
        
          - Corrected a typo in the logrotate template, which prevented the zeo log
            to be rotated.
            [hannosch]
        
        
        2.6.2 - July 16, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
          - Corrected even more references of instance to instance1 in proxy support
            and logrotate handling.
            [hannosch]
        
        
        2.6.1 - July 16, 2008
        ---------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
          - Changed the http_port to start at base_port + 10, to make room for
            additional services.
            [hannosch]
        
          - Corrected hide_summary option, to not show the summary twice.
            [hannosch]
        
        2.6 - July 15, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
          - Corrected one last reference of instance to instance1 in the zopepy eggs
            option of the plone_hosting template.
            [hannosch]
        
        2.5 - July 15, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Hosting template:
        
          - fix test for Varnish-support in the supervisord configuration.
            [wichert]
        
          - Rename the instance part to instance1 and add an instances group. This
            makes it possible to upgrade to multiple instances later on without
            having to break invocations.
            [wichert]
        
        2.4 - July 9, 2008
        ------------------
        
        * Restore the cwd after running buildout in the hosting recipe so further
          processing works correctly.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add a hook in the hosting template to not show the summary. This
          can be used by derived templates that want to show their own summary
          or show it at a later point.
          [wichert]
        
        * Set default Plone version to 3.1.3.
          [wichert]
        
        * Added kss plugin template
          [gotcha, jfroche, adrien01]
        
        * Silva layout have been merged with Silva all in the development
          buildout.

        2.3 - June 24, 2008
        -------------------
        
        * Fix problem in the hosting template: varnish was always enabled
          even if not desired.
          [wichert]
        
        * Added ZopeSkel test layer with the apropriate testSetup and testTearDown.
          The steps in the top of each test file is not anymore needed: delete
          tempdir/plone.example and then cd to tempdir.
          [mustapha]
        
        * Make the zope2product option in the archetype template default to true.
          [mustapha]
        
        * Modified buildout.cf to only test zopeskel.
          [mustapha]
        
        * Fixed the paster test function: overwrite option should default to True for
          the create command.
          [mustapha]
        
        * Added ``use_local_commands`` attribute (a la use_cheetah). A zopeskel
          template that wants to use local commands has to set it to True .
          [mustapha]
        
        * Get rid of zopeskel.txt and use setup.cfg to store the parent template name.
          [mustapha]
        
        * Sub-templates may define a parent_template attribute with the list of
          templates that can use it.
          [mustapha]
        
        * Fixed tests and updated docs.
          [mustapha]
        
        Version 2.2
        -----------
        
        * Install Plone 3.1.2 by default.
          [wichert]
        
        * Remove useless spans from the portlet template.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add supervisorctl configuration.
          [wichert]
        
        
        Version 2.1
        -----------
        
        * Revert BaseTemplate usage from the hosting template (changeset
          57368 from Tarek). It was not used and broke the buildout. This fixes
          http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/8
          [wichert]
        
        * Replace the generic README in the plone_hosting template with documentation
          that is important for deployments.
          [wichert]
        
        * Add log rotation support to the hosting buildout. Merged from Jarn's
          bones package.
          [wichert]
        
        
        Version 2.0
        -----------
        
        * Switch plone_hosting template to using supervisord to manage processes.
          Merged from Jarn's bones package.
          [wichert]
        
        * Reduced the number of questions to generate an atschema and used
          the MessageFactory instead of declaring an i18n_domain attribute
          [mustapha]
        
        * Fixed missing imports in plone2_theme
          [mustapha]
        
        * Removed unused imports in plone_pas
          [mustapha]
        
        * In plone2.5_theme: when the skinname is empty, replace it with a
          default text, otherwise adding a Plone Site will throw an error when
          displaying the extension profiles.
          [maurits]
        
        * Added note to profiles.zcml of plone2.5_theme that
          five.registerPackage needs Five version 1.4.
          [maurits]
        
        * Added a BUILDBOT.txt file.
          [tarek]
        
        * plone3_portlet: added commented out alternative AddForm for when
          there are no configurable parameters.  That was shorter than listing
          all the changes (where we forgot one).
          [maurits]
        
        * Fixed typos in archetyps and plone3 portlets: 'portletBotomLeft'
          should have been 'portletBottomLeft' with two 't's.
          [maurits]
        
        * Made plone3_portlet respect pep8 (and pyflakes).
          [maurits]
        
        * Use 1.0 as default version number for all templates. This is a more sensible
          default than 0.1 since we start of with dev-versions anyway.
          [wichert]
        
        * sub-templates per ZopeSkel template: Only sub-templates related to the parent
          template is visible with the -l option
          [mustapha]
        
        * added -a (--list-all) option to show all subtemplates regardless of the
          current project. Subtemplates that are not for the type of the current
          project are prefixed with N
          [mustapha]
        
        * Fixed the recreation of the paster_plugins.txt metadata file for archetype.
          For now we have to run 2 times the egg_info command to get the paster_plugins
          file recreated (setuptools problem: nice task to fix)
          [mustapha]
        
        * fixed the case of many inner packages: ask the user to choose a packe to
          inject content into if the command is run outside of an inner package
          [mustapha]
        
        * make all ZopeSkel templates that inherits from BaseTemplate addcontent aware
          [mustapha]
        
        * Added plone_pas template for PlonePas projects and many subtemplates
          [mustapha]
        
        * regrouped archetype subtemplates in templates/archetype
          [mustapha]
        
        * added and fixed tests
          [mustapha]
        
        
        Version 1.10
        ------------
        
        * Install Plone 3.1.1 as default option.
          [wichert]
        
        * Fixed a problem with ZopeSkel localcommands when we have multiple
          projects, it was getting the first directory always and sometimes
          the package dir was not the first directory, so when running the
          addcontent in the package it was creating the contents in the wrong
          dir. Thanks to wichert for pointing me this file.
          [dsa]
        
        * Update the hosting template to make running of buildout optional.
          [wichert]
        
        * Update the hosting template to test if a port is already in use and
          abort if so.
          [wichert]
        
        * Update the hosting template to only ask for a single base port number.
          [wichert]
        
        * Fix broken creation of Plone 3.1(.x) sites.
          [wichert]
        
        
        Version 1.9
        -----------
        
        * Install Plone 3.1 as default option.
          [wichert]
        
        * Fixed a missing 'import os' in the plone2_theme template. [davisagli]
        
        * Fix an ambiguous question in the silva_buildout template, and update
          the generated README file. [thefunny]
        
        
        Version 1.8
        -----------
        
        * fixed the recipe template buildout.cfg generation, thanks Kai ;)
          [tarek]
        
        Version 1.7
        -----------
        
        * Update the templates to have README.txt and HISTORY.txt in valid
          restructured format and use those as the package's long description.
          This automatically gives packages a more readable page on PyPI
          (and PSC with Tarek's excellent changes).
          [wichert]
        
        * Adjust the trove classifiers on the packages to not claim incorrect
          frameworks: we should only claim frameworks on which the package
          can run directly. So, for example, do not claim Zope2 of we also need
          Plone on top of Zope2.
          [wichert]
        
        
        Version 1.6
        -----------
        
        * Add templates for a Silva buildout.
          [thefunny]
        
        * Add a metadata.xml to all generated GenericSetup profiles. This is
          required by new versions of GenericSetup.
          [wichert]
        
        * For nested namespace packages we need to declare both namespace
          levels as namespace packages. This is a requirement for current
          versions of setuptools.
          [wichert]
        
        * Use Plone 3.0.6 as default version for new Plone hosting buildouts
          [wichert]
        
        
        Version 1.5.1
        -------------
        
        * Fix #2 (missing import in 'hosting.py') at
          http://plone.org/products/zopeskel/issues/2
          [nouri]
        
        Version 1.5
        -----------
        
        * added a new local command into archetype template to inject
          new content types [spanky]
        
        * added a doctest for each template, and refactored the package
          so we have one python module per template [tarek]
        
        * Refactored the zc.buildout recipe to provide structured documention
          that will render nicely on PyPI, added comments for recipe authors
          to help writing documentation and tests and added a working doctest
          skeleton. Implemented automatic license classifiers for common
          licenses in the generated setup.py. The mapping is in zopeskel.base
          and can be used for other templates also.
          [dokai]
        
        * The 'five:registerPackage' ZCML directive is added in a project based on the
          'plone' template only if the top level namespace package is not
          called 'Products'. This avoids having the product loaded twice in Zope.
          [davconvent]
        
        * Added paragraph about old style Zope 2 Product installation in the
          INSTALL.txt_tmpl file of the plone template.
          The paragraph will be added to the installation instructions if the top
          level namespace package is called 'Products'.
          [davconvent]
        
        Version 1.4
        -----------
        
        * Set the version number for plone.recipe.plone in a new versions part in
          buildout.cfg. That works around a buildout bug: buildout breaks if you change
          the revision pin for a recipe.
          [wichert]
        
        * Fixed bug: when running 'paster create' with --no-interactive option,
          the package variable given in the command line is ignored.
          [Mustapha]
        
        Version 1.3.4
        -------------
        
        * Added MANIFEST.in to prevent bad releases from svn exports.
          [fschulze]
        
        Version 1.3.3
        -------------
        
        * Move to the newly released Varnish 1.1.2.
          [wichert]
        
        * Remove bad import which broke localcommand support.
          [deo]
        
        * Remove unneeded imports and whitespace cleanup.
          [deo]
        
        Version 1.3.2
        -------------
        
        * Small fix in plone3_theme that did not install correctly with easy_install
          because of some files missing the the egg informations (added MANIFEST.in).
          [davconvent]
        
        Version 1.3.1
        -------------
        
        * Added 'addcontent' local command to make possible injecting content types
          in ZopeSkel projects and make the Archetype template 'addcontent' aware.
          [mustapha]
        
        * Updated to Plone 3.0.4.
          [fschulze]
        
        * Rerelease because of a bad egg.
          [fschulze]
        
        Version 1.3
        -----------
        
        * added the `recipe` template
          [tarek]
        
        * Add Plone 2.5.5.
          [wichert]
        
        Version 1.2
        -----------
        
        * Merge a slightly stripped down version of the Jarn Plone hosting template.
          This provides a convenient way to create a buildout for all Plone 2.5 and
          3.0 versions with ZEO and optional Varnish based caching.
